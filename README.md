# reverseArray

Hey everyone!

Recently I've decided to solve some tasks on the topics I've learned in Java. And one of them is Arrays.
This is an application that reads some user input and creates the reversed array. 
The method <i>getArr()</i> asks a user to insert some integer numers that are going to be saved in the array. This array will be passed
to the next method <i>reverse()</i>. It loops through the half of the array and swaps the last element with the current one (i).

For further explanations see my comments in the code. <br>

If you have any remarks and/or suggestions to my code, please let me know.

Have fun!
